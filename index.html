                    Who is Hestia?
                </h1>
            </div>
            <h4 class="container con-sm">
                Hestia is the Ancient Greek goddess of the hearth and the right ordering of domesticity, home, family, and state.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Her name is the Greek word for "hearth" and in the Ancient Greek religion, she was synonymous with it. She presided over all hearths, public and private, even those of Mount Olympus. Unlike other deities, Hestia was rarely portrayed by a symbol or anthropomorphic likeness. When she was, she was plain and modest.
            </p>
            <h4 class="container con-sm">
                The fires of hearths were to be kept burning at all times.
            </h4>
            <aside class="container con-med">     
                The goddess Vesta is her Roman equivalent. Her cult of maidens maintained the public flames as Hestia's priests and priestesses did in Greece.
            </aside>
            <p>
                In most households, a single hearth, typically tended by the matriarch, served as a central fixture to the home and family: a hub of warmth, comfort, cooking, and communion with the gods. If a flame were to go out by negligence or accident, it was seen as a failure of domestic and religious care. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the public domain, Hestia did not have official sanctuaries as prominently as the other gods; instead, she was venerated at the prytaneum, the hearth at the city center. When a household hearth was extinguished, a member of the family would carry a new flame from the prytaneum to their home. Likewise, when a new colony was established, a flame from Hestia's public hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement. While these practices were accompanied by important rituals, they had practical benefits as well: for instance, starting a fire from scratch was often more difficult and time-consuming than transporting an existing flame. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="container con-sm">
                New hearth, who dis?
            </h4>
            <p>
            <aside class="container con-med">    
                One astonishing example of a natural eternal flame in Austrailia is a coal seam called Mount Wingen which has burned continuously for over 6,000 years.
            </aside>
            </p>
            <p>
                The modern equivalent of the hearth is the furnace, water heater, and oven. Coincidentally, the gas powered versions of these appliances burn continually via pilot light! Their maintenance and fuel has been largely automated and outsourced to the workers and technologies of a natural gas provider. Even natural gas extraction sites and industrial plants utilize gas flares and flare stacks which themselves have pilot lights burning continuously, giving them a slight resemblance to the prytaneum, though without the spiritual significance. While letting a hearth flame go out in the days of Ancient Greece was seen as inconvenient, disrespectful, and a bad omen, the pilot light serves a crucial safety measure, the failure of which could spell very real danger.
